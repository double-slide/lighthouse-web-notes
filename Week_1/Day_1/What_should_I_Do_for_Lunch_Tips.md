## Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively – that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript

const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {

  if (hungry === false) {
    console.log("Get back to work!");
  } else if (hungry === true && availableTime < 20) {
    console.log("Pick something up and eat it in the lab.");
  } else if (hungry === true && availableTime >= 20 && availableTime < 30) {
    console.log("Try a place nearby!");
  } else if (hungry === true && availableTime > 30) {
    console.log("You're in bootcamp. Reconsider how much free time you have.");
  } else {
    console.log("Bad input.");
  }

  return "";

};


/*
 * This is some test runner code that's simply calling our whatToDoForLunch function
 * defined above to verify we're making the right decisions. Do not modify it!
 */

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 20 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 20);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 50 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 50);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm not hungry and I have 30 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(false, 30);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 15 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 15);

```
